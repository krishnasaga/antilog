# Antilog
A simple replacement of console log

We have an abundance of technical stack with wich we are able to build sofisticated systems and solveing complex problems

## Problem

50 to 90% of the time spent by an avrage developer in a day is on 
  - Resolving dependencies
  - fixing build errors
  - fixing Server startup errors
  - Finding correct documentation
  
And spending only 5 to 10% of time in solving real problem and innovation

## Solution

#### What a develoer will do when he encounderd an error on console 
   - Go to the line of code if ther is line number and fix it if he is fimelier with it
   - If he is not femiler with that error, google the error messge and find the fix
   - next time when he got the same error he will fix it with out searching 
   - it will take few week to months for the developer to get fimelier with all the common errors in the system
   - next want to use intrduce another new library or tecqunic and the process reperats

Findig right solution for build erros and other common erros which encountered by an avrage developer is a simple `machine learning` problem.

#### What we need
  
  - Dataset of errors and solutions
  - Algrothem to find the best soluton and improving the datase
  
An avrage deeloper is spending time on looking at console logs rather focusing on solving actual problem and innovating new things.

## What changes it can bring ?

 - It makes learning and adopting to a new technology stack less painful
 - An avrage developer can be more innovative
