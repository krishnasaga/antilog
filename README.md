# Antilog
A simple replacement of console log

## We got an abundance of technical stack with wich we are able to build sofisticated systems and solveing complex problems


## Problem

50 to 90% of the time spent by an avrage developer in a day is on 
  - Resolving dependencies
  - fixing build errors
  - fixing Server startup errors
  - Finding correct documentation
  
And spending only 5 to 10% of time in solving real problem and innovation

## Solution

Findig right solution for build erros and other common erros which encountered by an avrage developer is a simple `machine learning` problem.  

An avrage deeloper is spending time on locking at console logs ragher focusing on actual problem and innovating.

## What changes it can bring ?

 - It makes learning and adopting to a new technology stack less painful
 - An avrage developer can be more innovative
